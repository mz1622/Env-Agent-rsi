"""EnvHarness: autogenous environment scaling through harness mutation.

Top-level layout
----------------
- envharness.core           data contracts + ActionableEnv / EnvHarness
                            ABCs + Tool + code loader + registries
- envharness.harnesses      concrete EnvHarness implementations
                            (Setup, Rules)
- envharness.persistence    save / load for (env + harness stack)
- envharness.bridges        per-benchmark ActionableEnv implementations
                            (toy24, alfworld, swebench, webarena)
- envharness.orchestration  outer loop: Orchestrator, Runner, ...
- envharness.agents         PolicyAgent and search-driving LLM agents
- envharness.infra          cross-cutting: LLM clients, endpoint pool, utils
- envharness.prompts        optional per-bench prompt builders

LLM-emitted Rules code only needs `Rules` plus the data contracts
(`Action`, `Blocked`, `Observation`, `EnvResponse`) -- they are
re-exported here so the LLM can `from envharness import Rules, Action,
Blocked, Observation, EnvResponse` without knowing the subpackage layout.

# Auto-register the dependency-free base ActionableEnv (toy24).
# Heavier bridges (alfworld, swebench, webarena) carry runtime deps
# (alfworld[full], docker, playwright) and must be imported explicitly by
# the user before `load_checkpoint` can resolve their env_type tag::
#
#     import envharness.bridges.alfworld   # registers "alfworld"
#     env = load_checkpoint("path/to/cp.json")
#
# This is a deliberate trade-off: keeping `import envharness` cheap and
# dependency-light, at the cost of one extra import line for non-toy24
# benches. The error from load_checkpoint when a tag is unknown lists
# every registered env so the user can see what's missing.
