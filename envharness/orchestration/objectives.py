"""MutationObjective ABC + built-in implementations.

Each Objective consumes recent traces and outputs an ObjectiveSignal
(score + diagnostic + suggestion_prompt + optional weights). Rules's
operation mechanism is fixed; what it optimizes is whatever Objective is
plugged in.

Objective only specifies DIRECTION, not concrete numerical mutations. The
HarnessAgent LLM reads the suggestion_prompt and decides the actual values.
