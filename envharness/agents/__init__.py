"""Agents that DRIVE the harness-search loop.

`HarnessAgent` is the ABC the orchestrator talks to: it proposes, evaluates,
and refines independent Stage (`Setup`) plus Contract f_A/f_T/f_O (`Rules`)
changes, then observes the K-rollout outcomes.

Renamed from the old `Rules` ABC because the EnvHarness implementation
that actually wraps the env is now called `Rules` (the `_Rules(Rules)`
the LLM emits); the agent that DRIVES the search is the `HarnessAgent`.
