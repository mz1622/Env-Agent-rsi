"""Compile + load Rules-emitted Python source.

Contract: the source MUST define a top-level class named `_Rules` that
subclasses `Rules` (`envharness.harnesses.rules:Rules`). The class
is loaded in a controlled namespace that exposes the public framework
symbols (`Rules`, `Action`, `Blocked`, `Observation`, `EnvResponse`).
Failure modes raise `RulesCodeError` with a message shaped to be useful
when fed back to the LLM for self-repair.

Used by:
- `Rules.from_state(state)` when loading a checkpoint.
- The orchestrator's runner when applying a Candidate that carries
  `rules_code` (a Rules-emitted harness).
