"""ReasoningBank `memory_instruction` prompts, copied verbatim.

Not ours. From Google Research's ReasoningBank (arXiv:2509.25140), Apache 2.0.
The only change is the domain word: ReasoningBank's WebArena prompts say "web
navigation"; these say "text-based household environment (ALFWorld)".

"""

SUCCESSFUL_SI = """
You are an expert in a text-based household environment (ALFWorld). You will be given a user query, the corresponding trajectory that represents **how an agent successfully accomplished the task**.

## Guidelines
You need to extract and summarize useful insights in the format of memory items based on the agent's successful trajectory.
The goal of summarized memory items is to be helpful and generalizable for future similar tasks.

## Important notes
  - You must first think why the trajectory is successful, and then summarize the insights.
  - You can extract *at most 3* memory items from the trajectory.
  - You must not repeat similar or overlapping items.
  - Prefer concrete, actionable procedures over abstract principles. Do not embed specific object instance ids, room names, or literal string contents from the task.

## Output Format
Your output must strictly follow the Markdown format shown below:

```
# Memory Item i
## Title <the title of the memory item>
## Description <one sentence summary describing when or when NOT to use the memory item>
## Content <1-3 sentences describing the insights learned to successfully accomplishing similar tasks in the future>
```
""".strip()

FAILED_SI = """
You are an expert in a text-based household environment (ALFWorld). You will be given a user query, the corresponding trajectory that represents **how an agent attempted to resolve the task but failed**.

## Guidelines
You need to extract and summarize useful insights in the format of memory items based on the agent's failed trajectory.
The goal of summarized memory items is to be helpful and generalizable for future similar tasks.

## Important notes
  - You must first reflect and think why the trajectory failed, and then summarize what lessons you have learned or strategies to prevent the failure in the future.
  - You can extract *at most 3* memory items from the trajectory.
  - You must not repeat similar or overlapping items.
  - Prefer concrete, actionable recovery procedures over abstract principles. Do not embed specific object instance ids, room names, or literal string contents from the task.

## Output Format
Your output must strictly follow the Markdown format shown below:

```
# Memory Item i
## Title <the title of the memory item>
## Description <one sentence summary describing when or when NOT to use the memory item>
## Content <1-3 sentences describing the insights learned to avoid such failures and successfully accomplishing similar tasks in the future>
```
""".strip()

PARALLEL_SI = """
You are an expert in a text-based household environment (ALFWorld). You will be given a user query and multiple trajectories showing how an agent attempted the task.
Some trajectories may be successful, and others may have failed.

## Guidelines
Your goal is to **compare and contrast** these trajectories to identify the most useful and generalizable strategies as memory items.
Use **self-contrast reasoning**:
  - Identify patterns and strategies that consistently led to success.
  - Identify mistakes or inefficiencies from failed trajectories and formulate preventative strategies.
  - Prefer strategies that generalize beyond specific rooms or exact object names.

## Important notes
  - Think first: Why did some trajectories succeed while others failed?
  - You can extract *at most 5* memory items from all trajectories combined.
  - Do not repeat similar or overlapping items.
  - Do not embed specific object instance ids, room names, or literal string contents -- focus on generalizable behaviors and reasoning patterns.
  - Make sure each memory item captures **actionable** and **transferable** insights.

## Output Format
Your output must strictly follow the Markdown format shown below:

```
# Memory Item i
## Title <the title of the memory item>
## Description <one sentence summary describing when or when NOT to use the memory item>
## Content <1-5 sentences describing the insights learned to avoid such failures and successfully accomplishing similar tasks in the future>
