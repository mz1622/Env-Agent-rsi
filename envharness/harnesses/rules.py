"""Rules -- the EnvHarness with A / T / O transformation hooks.

`Rules` wraps an inner ActionableEnv and applies up to three per-step
pure-function hooks:

  - filter_action(action, env_state)               -- A axis
  - modify_transition(action, response, env_state) -- T axis
  - filter_observation(obs, env_state)             -- O axis

Initial-state changes use the separate Stage protocol implemented by
`Setup.actions`: Setup replays each action through `inner.step(action)`
before the Policy starts.

All hook defaults are pass-through. A useful `Rules` is a SUBCLASS that
overrides one or more hooks -- which is what the HarnessAgent
emits as Python source. The framework loads that source, finds the
`_Rules` subclass, and instantiates it with `inner=<the wrapped env>`.

Example of LLM-emitted code::

    class _Rules(Rules):
        def filter_action(self, action, env_state):
            if action.name == "combine" and action.kwargs.get("op") == "div":
                return Blocked(reason="division disabled")
            return action

Saved state is the Python source string; loading recompiles it.
