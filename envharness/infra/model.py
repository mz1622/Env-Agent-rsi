"""Single place that turns a model id into a ready-to-use client spec.

Every stage -- corpus, induction, evaluation -- asks this module for its
client instead of naming a client class and hand-assembling provider kwargs.
Switching provider is then one string in a config:

    openai/gpt-4.1-mini
    gemini/gemini-3.5-flash
    vertex_ai/claude-sonnet-4-6

A bare name is accepted too (`gpt-4.1`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gemini-3.5-flash`);
the provider is inferred from the family prefix.

Why a resolver at all, when litellm already dispatches on the prefix:

  * Auth differs per provider. OpenAI and Gemini read an API key from the
    environment; Vertex uses ADC plus a project/region pair whose env-var
    names are litellm's (VERTEXAI_*), not the ones the Anthropic SDK uses.
  * Parameters are not portable. `reasoning_effort` is native on Gemini,
    unsupported on `gpt-4.1` (litellm raises UnsupportedParamsError before
    the request leaves the process), and on Claude it is translated into a
    thinking budget that the API rejects unless `max_tokens` exceeds it.
    A config written for one provider must not explode on another.

Both are handled here so callers can stay provider-agnostic.
