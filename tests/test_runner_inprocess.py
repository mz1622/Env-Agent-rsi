"""Run an episode through `run_episode` (InProcessRunner path) with the
new ActionableEnv + EnvHarness wiring.

Verifies that:
  - the runner builds the env stack from (EnvSpec, Candidate) correctly
  - a Rules-mutated env applies its `filter_action` hook during the loop
  - blocked actions show up on Step.blocked_reason
  - the resulting Trace records what the agent saw
