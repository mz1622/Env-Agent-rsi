"""Tests for code_loader -- how LLM-emitted Python becomes a live Rules.

This is the trust boundary: the LLM writes arbitrary Python and we exec it.
Failure modes (syntax errors, wrong class name, wrong base class, runtime
errors during instantiation) should turn into typed `RulesCodeError`s
with helpful messages, NOT crash the subprocess worker.
