"""The A/T/O hooks on Rules.

Rules is the EnvHarness implementation that wraps an inner ActionableEnv
with three pure-function hooks: filter_action (A), modify_transition (T),
filter_observation (O). All defaults are pass-through; subclasses override
the axes they care about. These tests pin those defaults -- if the default
of any hook changes, update these expectations.

For tests that exercise the full step loop (filter_action firing through
Rules.step over an inner ActionableEnv), see test_envharness_composition.py.

Initial-state changes use the separate Stage protocol implemented by Setup.
